# AutoGPT 💬

AutoGPT is a lightweight, interactive web application that leverages Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to generate real-time AI responses based on user prompts. Built using Streamlit, this app creates a simple yet powerful interface where users can input custom text queries and receive intelligent responses directly from a large language model (LLM) via Google’s Generative AI API.

This project demonstrates the integration of modern LLM APIs into a responsive Python web interface, focusing on rapid prototyping, prompt engineering, and secure API key handling using environment variables.
